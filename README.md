# workday-scheduler

## HTML
With the precode I was able to add a couple classes to each time block to allow it to correspond with JavaScript. I replicated each time block, and adjusted the times per div allowing the schedule to display 9am-5pm. 

## CSS
CSS was already precoded again. Not a whole lot done on this section other than linking the file properly to my html file. 

## JavaScript
This was the most challenging section for me. I was having some trouble saving to local storage, but was able to finally get the text to save after each refresh. This allows the schedule to change color depending on the time.
